# **`What is SOLID?`**
The SOLID principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns, they are:
- [Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/JahidulHasanSuhel/Concepts-of-SOLID/blob/master/SingleResponsibility.md)
- [Open-Closed Principle](https://github.com/JahidulHasanSuhel/Concepts-of-SOLID/blob/master/OpenClosed.md)
- [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://github.com/JahidulHasanSuhel/Concepts-of-SOLID/blob/master/LiskovSubstitution.md)
- [Interface Segregation Principle](https://github.com/JahidulHasanSuhel/Concepts-of-SOLID/blob/master/InterfaceSegregation.md)
- [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://github.com/JahidulHasanSuhel/Concepts-of-SOLID/blob/master/DependencyInversion.md)

They are a set of five principles that help us to write better code, they are not rules, but guidelines that **help us to write code that is easier to maintain, understand and extend**.
